Description: appfy.recipe.gae
        ================
        
        `appfy.recipe.gae` provides a series of `zc.buildout <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout>`_
        recipes to help with `Google App Engine <http://code.google.com/appengine/>`_
        development. It is inspired by `rod.recipe.appengine <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rod.recipe.appengine>`_,
        but using a different layout and with extended functionalities. It is also
        split in different recipes. Currently `appfy.recipe.gae` has 3 recipes:
        
        :appfy.recipe.gae\:app_lib: Downloads libraries from PyPi and installs in
        the app directory.
        :appfy.recipe.gae\:sdk: Downloads and installs the App Engine SDK.
        :appfy.recipe.gae\:tools: Installs a python executable and several SDK
        scripts in the buildout directory: appcfg, bulkload_client, bulkloader,
        dev_appserver and remote_api_shell. It also allows to set default values
        to start the dev_appserver.
        
        Source code and issue tracker can be found at `http://code.google.com/p/appfy/ <http://code.google.com/p/appfy/>`_.
        
        For an example of how appfy makes distribution of App Engine apps easy and
        nice, see `Moe installation instructions <http://www.tipfy.org/wiki/moe/>`_.
        
        
        appfy.recipe.gae:app_lib
        ------------------------
        Downloads libraries from PyPi and installs in the app directory. This recipe
        extends `zc.recipe.egg.Scripts <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.egg>`_,
        so all the options from that recipe are also valid.
        
        Options
        ~~~~~~~
        
        :eggs: Package names to be installed.
        :lib-directory: Destination directory for the libraries. Default is
        `distlib`.
        :use-zipimport: If `true`, a zip file with the libraries is created
        instead of a directory. The zip filename will be the value of
        `lib-directory` plus `.zip`.
        :ignore-globs: A list of glob patterns to not be copied from the library.
        :ignore-packages: A list of top-level package names or modules to be ignored.
        This is useful to ignore dependencies that won't be used. Some packages may
        install distribute, setuptools or pkg_resources but these are not very
        useful on App Engine, so you can set them to be ignored, for example.
        :delete-safe: If `true`, always move `lib-directory` to a temporary directory
        inside the parts dir as a backup when building, instead of deleting it.
        This is to avoid accidental deletion if `lib-directory` is badly
        configured. Default to `true`.
        
        Example
        ~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
        [app_lib]
        # Sets the library dependencies for the app.
        recipe = appfy.recipe.gae:app_lib
        lib-directory = app/distlib
        use-zipimport = false
        
        # Define the libraries.
        eggs =
        tipfy
        
        # Don't copy files that match these glob patterns.
        ignore-globs =
        *.c
        *.pyc
        *.pyo
        */test
        */tests
        */testsuite
        */django
        */sqlalchemy
        
        # Don't install these packages or modules.
        ignore-packages =
        distribute
        setuptools
        easy_install
        site
        pkg_resources
        
        
        appfy.recipe.gae:sdk
        --------------------
        
        Downloads and installs the App Engine SDK in the buildout directory.
        
        Options
        ~~~~~~~
        
        :url: URL to the App Engine SDK file.
        :destination: Destination of the extracted SDK. Default is the parts directory.
        :clear-destination: If `true`, deletes the destination dir before
        extracting the download. Default is `true`.
        
        Example
        ~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
        [gae_sdk]
        # Dowloads and extracts the App Engine SDK.
        recipe = appfy.recipe.gae:sdk
        url = http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/google_appengine_1.3.5.zip
        destination = ${buildout:parts-directory}
        hash-name = false
        clear-destination = true
        
        
        appfy.recipe.gae:tools
        ----------------------
        
        Installs a python executable and several SDK scripts in the buildout
        directory: appcfg, bulkload_client, bulkloader, dev_appserver and
        remote_api_shell.
        
        It also allows to set default values to start the dev_appserver.
        
        This recipe extends `zc.recipe.egg.Scripts <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.recipe.egg>`_,
        so all the options from that recipe are also valid.
        
        Options
        ~~~~~~~
        
        :sdk-directory: Path to the App Engine SDK directory. It can be an
        absolute path or a reference to the `appfy.recipe.gae:sdk` destination
        option. Default is `${buildout:parts-directory}/google_appengine`.
        :appcfg-script: Name of the appcfg script to be installed in the bin
        directory.. Default is `appcfg`.
        :bulkload_client-script: Name of the bulkloader script to be installed in
        the bin directory. Default is `bulkload_client`.
        :bulkloader-script: Name of the bulkloader script to be installed in
        the bin directory. Default is `bulkloader`.
        :dev_appserver-script: Name of the dev_appserver script to be installed in
        the bin directory. Default is `dev_appserver`.
        :remote_api_shell-script: Name of the remote_api_shell script to be
        installed in the bin directory. Default is `remote_api_shell`.
        :config-file: Configuration file with the default values to use in
        scripts. Default is `gaetools.cfg`.
        :extra-paths: Extra paths to include in sys.path for generated scripts.
        
        Example
        ~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
        [gae_tools]
        # Installs appcfg, dev_appserver and python executables in the bin directory.
        recipe = appfy.recipe.gae:tools
        sdk-directory = ${gae_sdk:destination}/google_appengine
        
        # Add these paths to sys.path in the generated scripts.
        extra-paths =
        app/lib
        app/distlib
        
        Note that this example references an `gae_sdk` section from the
        `appfy.recipe.gae:sdk` example. An absolute path could also be used.
        
        To set default values to start the dev_appserver, create a section
        `dev_appserver` in the defined configuration file (`gaetools.cfg` by
        default). For example::
        
        [dev_appserver]
        # Set default values to start the dev_appserver. All options from the
        # command line are allowed. They are inserted at the beginning of the
        # arguments. Values are used as they are; don't use variables here.
        recipe = appfy.recipe.gae:tools
        defaults =
        --datastore_path=var/data.store
        --history_path=var/history.store
        --blobstore_path=var/blob.store
        app
        
        
        Each option should be set in a separate line, as displayed above. Options
        provided when calling dev_appserver will override the default values.
        
        
        Versions
        ========
        Version 0.9.2 - December 03, 2010
        ---------------------------------
        - Changed requirements::
        
        zc.buildout >= 1.5.2
        z3c.recipe.scripts >= 1.0.1
        zc.recipe.egg >= 1.3.2
        
        
        Version 0.9.1 - November 27, 2010
        ---------------------------------
        - Readded option 'clear-destination' to the dowanlod recipe, true by default.
        It was causing an error when the files existed, and 'ignore-existing' wasn't
        avoiding it.
        
        
        Version 0.9 - November 23, 2010
        -------------------------------
        - Scripts now extends z3c.recipe.scripts.scripts.Scripts, for better
        compatibility with buildout 1.5.2.
        - appfy.recipe.gae.sdk accepts a sha1sum option, to check the SDK checksum as
        provided by Google.
        - removed hexagonit.recipe.download as it was not flexible enough to allow
        the sha1 checksum check.
        
        
        Version 0.8 - July 27, 2010
        ---------------------------
        - Do not raise IOError when egg info is not found, and let installation
        proceed only emitting a warning.
        
        
        Version 0.7.2 - June 18, 2010
        -----------------------------
        - os.makedirs(), not os.mkdirs(). Ooops.
        
        
        Version 0.7.1 - June 18, 2010
        -----------------------------
        - Minor enhancement: use os.mkdirs() instead of os.mkdir() when creating the
        backup for app_libs (Tom Lynn).
        
        
        Version 0.7 - June 17, 2010
        ---------------------------
        - Added multi-line top_level support. Now it can handle eggs with multiple
        lines in top_level.txt. Thanks to Benjamin Kampmann for this (Issue #3).
        
        - Added ignore-packages option, useful to ignore setuptools, distribute and
        other dependency packages not useful on App Engine.
        
        - Single modules are now also matched by ignore-globs.
        
        - ignore-globs now removes the non-related path prefix for better matching.
        
        - Documented extra-paths, useful to add libraries directories to sys.path in
        scripts.
        
        - Several refactorings and cleanups.
        
        
        Version 0.6.1 - June 3, 2010
        ----------------------------
        - Don't install package if egg info is not found, instead of breaking. This
        was causing a problem when setuptools is declared as dependency.
        
        
        Version 0.6 - June 1, 2010
        --------------------------
        - app_lib can now also install develop eggs.
        
        
        Version 0.5.2 - May 27, 2010
        ----------------------------
        - Single files are correctly installed.
        - Namespaced packages are put in the same directory structure. This was causing
        an error when trying to create a directory for the second time.
        
        
        Version 0.5.1 - May 17, 2010
        ----------------------------
        - appfy.recipe.gae:app_lib now extends zc.recipe.egg.Scripts, so that scripts
        from packages are installed, as before.
        
        
        Version 0.5 - May 5, 2010
        ---------------------------
        - Dropped checksum checking, and now move files to a backup directory if
        delete-safe is `true` (which is the default). This makes the build faster
        and avoids the annoying invalid checksum errors.
        
        
        Version 0.4.5 - May 5, 2010
        ---------------------------
        - Use tempfile.gettempdir() to save temporary files. Thanks, tlynn.
        
        
        Version 0.4.4 - May 3, 2010
        ---------------------------
        - Unzip eggs by default in app_lib or we can't use some.
        
        
        Version 0.4.3 - May 3, 2010
        ---------------------------
        - Only accepts multi-line configuration for gaetools.
        
        - Fixed tmpdir in app_lib.
        
        
        Version 0.4.2 - May 1st, 2010
        -----------------------------
        - app_lib now extends zc.recipe.egg.Eggs and sets default eggs to an empty
        string, just to avoid errors.
        
        - More small refactorings.
        
        
        Version 0.4.1 - May 1st, 2010
        -----------------------------
        - Removed `primary-lib-directory` option from app_lib.
        
        - Code cleanup and refactoring.
        
        
        Version 0.4 - April 30, 2010
        ----------------------------
        - Fixed script path problem when buildout is configured to use absolute paths.
        Fixes issue #1. Thanks Lacrima.Maxim for the report.
        
        - Scripts now run using alter_sys=True, so that help messages that use __doc__
        are displayed correctly.
        
        
        Version 0.3 - April 29, 2010
        ----------------------------
        - Added `config-file` option to appfy.recipe.gae:tools, to define the
        configuration file used to set default arguments for the scripts.
        
        
        Version 0.2 - April 29, 2010
        ----------------------------
        - Added bulkload_client, bulkloader and remote_api_shell scripts.
        
        - Fixed script entry-points: they were breaking on Windows; now they work.
        
        - All recipes are also tested and working on Windows now.
        
        
        Version 0.1 - April 28, 2010
        ----------------------------
